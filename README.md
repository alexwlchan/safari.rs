**Archived 11 February 2024:** this was a fun experiment in using Rust, but I'm no longer using or maintaining it – I've replaced it with JavaScript For Automation (JXA) scripts that I run directly.

# safari.rs

safari.rs provides some tools for interacting with Safari on the command-line.

## Commands

1.  Get the URL from a given window or tab:

    ```console
    $ # Get the URL of the frontmost tab of the frontmost window
    $ safari url
    https://github.com

    $ # Get a URL from the second window from the tab
    $ safari url --window=2
    https://example.com/foo

    $ # Third tab from the left of the second window
    $ safari url --window=2 --tab=3
    https://example.com/foo
    ```

    I have the first two commands bound to shortcuts `furl` and `2url` for quick access.

2.  Get a list of URLs from every open tab:

    ```console
    $ safari list-tabs
    https://github.com
    https://example.com/foo
    https://crates.io/crates/urlparse
    ...
    ```

3.  Go through and batch close tabs:

    ```console
    $ safari clean-tabs youtube.com,twitter.com
    ```

    I find this useful for quickly cutting down my open tabs.

4.  Get a list of URLs from Reading List:

    ```console
    $ safari reading-list
    ```

5.  Get a list of URLs from all your devices with iCloud Tabs:

    ```console
    $ safari icloud-tabs
    ```

    You can get a list of known devices with `icloud-tabs --list-devices`, and filter the URLs with the `--device` flag:

    ```console
    $ safari icloud-tabs --device="Alex's iPhone"
    ```

## Installation

You need [Rust installed][rust].
Then to install:

```console
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/alexwlchan/safari.rs
```

It's tested in Travis with the current version of stable Rust, but it only gets tested when it was last modified (at time of writing, that was Rust 1.40.0).

## URL transformations

The commands that produce URLs do a bit of cleaning before they return:

*   Convert links for a mobile site to the desktop site – for example, converting `mobile.twitter.com` to `twitter.com`.
*   Stripping tracking junk (e.g. UTM tracking parameters) from URLs.
*   Removing some extraneous information that isn't generally useful.

## Motivation

I first got the idea for a script to access Safari URLs [from Dr. Drang][dr].
I've been through several different versions – AppleScript, shell, Python –
gradually adding the cleaning features – and now I've written a new
version in Rust.

Why Rust?

*   It's really fast.  The Rust script returns immediately – when I tried writing this with Python, I had a noticeable delay when typing `;furl`.
    This is a tool I use dozens of times a week, so every second counts.
*   I like Rust, and I’ve been enjoying playing with it recently.
